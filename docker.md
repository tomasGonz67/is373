<h1>Introduction to Docker</h1>
Docker is an open source tool that helps developers build, run, and package an application (and all the things it needs like libraries, code, and settings) using software packages known as "containers." Docker can allow developers to ship code quickly, standardize application operations, improve resource utilization, simplify workloads, and stay ahead of security issues.
