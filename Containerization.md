# Containerization

## Definition
Containerization is a method of packaging software into a single "container." 
This container can run consistently on any computing environment, whether it's a developer's laptop, 
a server, or a cloud platform.

## Why Containerization?
Containerization eliminates issues where software works on one machine but not another
because of differences in environments. Containerization bundles the software and all 
its dependencies into a portable container.

## Importance
Containers provide a consistent environment for software applications, 
making it easier to develop, test, and deploy across different platforms.

## How it Works
Containers use a system's operating system to create isolated environments for each application. 
Unlike virtual machines (VMs), which require a full OS for each instance, containers share
 the host's OS, making them lightweight and faster to start.
