# Containerization

## Definition
Containerization is a method of packaging software into a single "container." 
This container can run consistently on any computing environment, whether it's a developer's laptop, 
a server, or a cloud platform.

## Why Containerization?
Containerization eliminates issues where software works on one machine but not another
because of differences in environments. Containerization bundles the software and all 
its dependencies into a portable container.

## Importance
Containers provide a consistent environment for software applications, 
making it easier to develop, test, and deploy across different platforms.

## How it Works
Containers use a system's operating system to create isolated environments for each application. 
Unlike virtual machines (VMs), which require a full OS for each instance, containers share
 the host's OS, making them lightweight and faster to start.

## Containerization vs Virtualization 

## Containerization
It allows multiple applications to run in isolated "containers" on the same computer.
These containers use the host's Operating System (OS), which is the software that manages
all hardware and software on a computer (like Windows, macOS, or Linux). 
Because containers share this single OS, they are lightweight (use less storage and memory) and fast to start up.

## Virtualization
This creates Virtual Machines (VMs) using a tool called a hypervisor. 
A VM is like a fully independent computer inside your main computer. 
Each VM has its own Operating System (OS), separate from the host's OS. 
This setup makes VMs heavier (use more storage and memory) and slower to start because each VM runs a full OS.
