<h1>Kernal</h1>
<h1>Definition</h1>
The Kenral is the core part of the operating system that manages system resources and allows communication between software and hardware.

<h1>Why Kernal?</h1>
The Kernal is responsible for many important tasks such as allocating and managing the system's memory. It manages the device by handling the communication between the system and hardware devices. It manages the file system by managing data storage and retreival from file systems. Lastly, it manages all the processes and thread: including theier creation, execution and termination. 

<h1>Importance</h1>
Without the Kernal, a system would be chaotic, insecure and insufficient. The Kernal provides is the central control allowing the entire system to function properly and it brings system effficiency by not allowing the system to become unresponsive or slow down. Also, the kernal provides security by ensuring overall stability/protecting the system from any unauthorized access and the kernal simplifies hardware interaction which enables compatibility where that brings ease of use for any developer.  

<h1>How it works?</h1>
In the user mode, most of the applications that run must request services from the kernal. In the kernal mode, the kernal operates in a privileged mode called kernal mode as this means it has unrestricted access to all system resources such as the hardware, memory and CPU. During the transition between both of these modes, the user-mode applications make system calls which means that it makes its requests to the kernal to perform taks like reading a file or alloacting memory.
