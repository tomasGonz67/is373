## Virtualization
This creates Virtual Machines (VMs) using a tool called a hypervisor. 
A VM is like a fully independent computer inside your main computer. 
Each VM has its own Operating System (OS), separate from the host's OS. 
This setup makes VMs heavier (use more storage and memory) and slower to start because each VM runs a full OS.
